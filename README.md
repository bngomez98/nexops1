Nexus Operations is a Next.js web application serving Topeka, KS and the surrounding region. Homeowners submit documented project requests — including photos, written scope, and a maximum budget — and licensed, insured contractors can claim projects exclusively. Projects are immediately removed from all other contractors' feeds upon claim.

**For homeowners:** Free to submit requests. Matched with one verified contractor, confirmed within 24 hours.

**For contractors:** Flat monthly membership ($299–$749/month). Unlimited project claims. No per-lead fees.

## Authentication

Role-based routing is enforced via `middleware.ts`. Two user roles exist:

- `homeowner` — access to `/dashboard/homeowner/*`
- `contractor` — access to `/dashboard/contractor/*`

Session tokens are validated server-side on every protected request. Unauthenticated users are redirected to `/login`.

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/auth/login` | Authenticate a user and issue a session |
| POST | `/api/auth/signup` | Register a new homeowner or contractor |
| POST | `/api/auth/logout` | Terminate the current session |
| GET | `/api/auth/me` | Return the authenticated user's profile |
| GET | `/api/leads` | Return available project requests (contractor-only) |
| GET/POST | `/api/requests` | Manage homeowner project submissions |

## Security

`middleware.ts` applies the following HTTP security headers on every response:

- `Strict-Transport-Security` (2-year max-age, includeSubDomains)
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `Content-Security-Policy`
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
- `Permissions-Policy` (camera, microphone, geolocation restricted)
- `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin`
- `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-origin`

## Deployment

The application is configured for deployment on Vercel. No additional configuration is required beyond connecting the repository. The `next.config.mjs` file does not require environment-specific overrides for basic deployment.
