    questions: [
      {
        q: "How do I submit a service request?",
        a: "Log in to your account, select the trade category, upload project photos, describe the scope of work, set a maximum budget, and provide your availability for a contractor consultation. Requests that meet all documentation requirements are routed to the contractor network.",
      },
      {
        q: "What information is required to submit a request?",
        a: "Every request requires: 2–10 project photos, a written scope of work describing what needs to be done, a maximum budget cap, the property address, and at least one preferred consultation window. Requests that do not meet these requirements cannot be submitted.",
      },
      {
        q: "Will multiple contractors contact me about my request?",
        a: "No. Only one contractor is assigned per request. Once a contractor claims your request, it is immediately removed from all other contractors' feeds. You will not receive calls, emails, or visits from competing contractors.",
      },
      {
        q: "How quickly will a contractor claim my request?",
        a: "Claim times vary by trade and availability in your area. When a contractor claims your request, both parties receive a confirmed consultation appointment within 24 hours. If no contractor is available, you will be notified directly — there is no indefinite waiting period.",
      },
      {
        q: "Am I obligated to hire the contractor after the consultation?",
        a: "No. After the consultation, the contractor provides a written, itemized estimate. You can accept the estimate, negotiate, or decline with no obligation or cancellation fees.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can I cancel a submitted request?",
        a: "Yes. You may cancel an open request at any time before a contractor claims it. Once a contractor has claimed and a consultation is scheduled, cancellations must be made at least 24 hours in advance. Repeated same-day cancellations may affect your account standing.",
      },
      {
        q: "I manage multiple properties. Can one account cover all of them?",
        a: "Yes. Property manager accounts support multiple property addresses under a single login, with per-property request history and tracking. Register as a Property Manager during sign-up or contact admin@nexusoperations.org to upgrade an existing account.",
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    category: "Contractors",
    questions: [
      {
        q: "What is required to join as a contractor?",
        a: "Contractor applications require: a valid Kansas contractor license (or equivalent trade license) and proof of current general liability insurance. All applications are reviewed manually by Nexus Operations staff. Applications missing required documentation will not be approved.",
      },
      {
        q: "How does the claim process work?",
        a: "When a new request matching your service categories and area is submitted, you receive a notification. The first qualified contractor to tap 'Claim' secures the request exclusively. The listing is removed from all other contractors' feeds at the moment of claim. You then receive the property owner's full contact information and a confirmed consultation appointment.",
      },
      {
        q: "What information do I receive before claiming a request?",
        a: "Before claiming, you can see: the service category, a brief project description, the property address, the budget ceiling, the number of photos attached, and the property owner's availability windows. Full photo access and direct contact information are provided after you claim.",
      },
      {
        q: "Is there a fee to join or claim requests?",
        a: "The Nexus contractor network is free to join and free to use. There are no signup fees, monthly subscriptions, per-claim charges, or referral percentages. Contractors receive project notifications, claim work, and are paid directly by the property owner.",
      },
      {
        q: "What happens if I claim a request but cannot make the consultation?",
        a: "Contact admin@nexusoperations.org as soon as possible. The request may be released back to the open pool at Nexus Operations' discretion. Repeated failures to honor claimed consultations will result in account suspension.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can I set which request types and geographic area I receive?",
        a: "Yes. Your contractor profile allows you to select active service categories (e.g., HVAC, Electrical, Roofing) and set a service radius in miles from your registered address. You will only receive notifications for requests that match both filters.",
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    category: "Platform Policies",
    questions: [
      {
        q: "Is Nexus Operations available outside Topeka, KS?",
        a: "Currently, Nexus Operations serves Topeka, Kansas and the immediate surrounding Shawnee County area. Expansion to additional markets will be announced on this site and via contractor newsletter.",
      },
      {
        q: "How are contractors verified?",
        a: "All contractors must submit a current contractor license and active insurance certificate before account approval. Documentation is reviewed manually by Nexus Operations staff. Credentials must remain current for continued network access.",
      },
      {
        q: "What happens to my submitted photos and project data?",
        a: "Project photos and details are used solely for matching you with a contractor and facilitating the consultation. Your data is never sold, shared with advertising networks, or distributed to multiple contractors. See the Privacy Policy for full data handling details.",
      },
      {
        q: "How do I contact Nexus Operations for support?",
        a: "Phone: (785) 428-0244, Monday through Friday 8am–6pm CT. Email: admin@nexusoperations.org.",
